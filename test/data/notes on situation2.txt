For a pool state [1000000, 2000000].
We can imagine that the first token represents mETH and the second one USD.

Assuming a 0.3% fee, we have the following possible swaps:
(a) 5000 ---> 9496
(b) 3836 <--- 8000

If users ask 1% more than what they would obtain directly from the pool, we have:

5000 ---> 9590
3874 <--- 8000

The solver can include the following amm swap:
1126 ---> 2220

and gain 630 units of token B.

Without nonce logic implemented, this tx costs approximately 300000 gas.
At a gas cost of 23 gwei, this means ~6.9 mETH of gas cost.
At 1 ETH = 2000 USD this is 13.8 USD.

Notice that users don't pay gas fee.
